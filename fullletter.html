    <h2>To: [HER NAME]</h2>

    <p>
        Today I celebrate you — not just for the day you were born,
        but for every beautiful moment you’ve brought into my life
        since the day we met.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for being my constant source of strength,
        laughter, and peace. With you, love feels gentle, safe,
        and full of warmth.
    </p>

    <p>
        I admire your kindness, your heart, your patience,
        and the way you always manage to make everything
        feel better just by being near.
    </p>

    <p>
        You inspire me to grow, to dream bigger,
        and to love more deeply.
        May this year bring you all the happiness
        you give to others.
    </p>

    <p>
        I promise to always be by your side
        in every version of your story.
    </p>

    <p>— Aydin 💛</p>
