    <h2>To: my sweetest love,</h2>

    <p>
        Sweet 17 ✨ It all started last year in Form 3, just two friends casually talking, laughing, and sharing small moments. 
        Who knew that from those ordinary days, we would grow so close—closer than I’ve ever been with anyone before. 
        You became my safe place, my laughter on cloudy days, and the kind of friend I never want to let go of.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, I just want to wish you the happiest birthday. I hope this year wraps you in warmth,
        fills your days with laughter, and gives you the courage to chase every dream you’ve ever had. 
        May you always feel proud of yourself, trust your heart, and never forget how special you are.
    </p>

    <p>
        I admire your kindness, your heart, your patience,
        and the way you always manage to make everything
        feel better just by being near.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you… for being patient with me, for every kind word, every laugh,
        every little thing you did that made me feel cared for. 
        I’ve never felt this way before, and honestly, no words can describe how much I feel right now.
        You’ve made my world softer, brighter, and infinitely sweeter.
    </p>

    <p>
   So here’s to you, my sweetest love. May this year be as wonderful as your heart, 
        as gentle as your smile, and as unforgettable as the person you are.
        Thank you for being you, for being here, and for letting me be a part of your story.
    </p>

    <p>— Aydin </p>
